mediaexperience.JS
==================

Simplified media queries using javascript created with noscript and IE fallback
in mind.

## Heads-up: Work in Progress ahead

Why I created another media query script:

1. simple as it gets
1. just sizing
1. columns available for extra control
1. IE support as aÂ side effect of writing CSS (as no-js in H5BP)

## jQuery dependency

This is in the state of proof of concept. That's why I have used jQuery for
faster development and testing this approach.

## How it works

Any element can be watched for changes of width and height. This way you can
design experience on element level instead of screen level.
